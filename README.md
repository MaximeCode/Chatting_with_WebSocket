# Chatting_with_WebSocket
First use of WebSocket. I realize a simple website where several peoples can talk together


1. In first, clone the repository.

2. In second, install the node_modules necessary for the WebSocket :
```sh
npm install
```

3. Then, launch the WebSocket with this command :
```sh
node server.js
```

4. Launch a web server, and open several customer with the localhost ip (for example) :
```sh
http://127.0.0.1:5500/
```

5. Normally, you can send messages in the input to others customers.

6. Also, you can view the log in your web browser console where i added some sentences to confirm the link between customers and WebSocket Server.
